Objective Foursquare
====================

What is it?
---------------------

Objective Foursquare is my own libraries for interfacing with the 
Foursquare API.

This is currently an *alpha release* and assumes you already have an oauth access token.

Future releases will also fetch a token, and contain more functionality.
